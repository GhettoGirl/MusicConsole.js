This file(s) are part of an upcoming project of mine.

This project is an attempt to port QStandardPaths to JavaScript and Node
to get common operating system standard paths.

At the moment this library only targets the generic config location.

Linux:   $XDG_CONFIG_DIR, fallback ~/.confg
macOS:   ~/Library/Preferences
Windows: C:/Users/<USER>/AppData/Local/<APPNAME>", "C:/ProgramData/<APPNAME>"

see http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstandardpaths.html for a full list
