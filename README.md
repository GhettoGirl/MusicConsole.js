# Music Console

A simple console app which organizes all of your media files for fast and easy access.

#### What is it?

**Music Console** is a console application which scans your filesystem for media files and stores a list in memory. You can search this list using a simple search term, the first match is opened in a player of your choice.</br>
*Sounds kinda boring?* Don't worry! Music Console has so much features to offer which makes it unique.

**NOTE THE DEV NOTICE BELOW**

## Requirements

[NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org) and `npm`

#### Running the application

 - Issue `npm install` to install all dependencies to run the application.
 - Now just type `node .` to get started.

I will create a proper startup script in the future.

## ~ Dev Notice ~

This project is a continuation of my old [Music Console](https://github.com/GhettoGirl/MusicConsole) written in C++11 and Qt5. I'm in the progess of learning NodeJS and Electron for any of my apps I will write in the future. C++ for GUI development got too lazy for me and it takes way too long. I need something future proof and Node/Electron got really popular these days.

For learning purposes and to gain experience in JavaScript, I decided to rewrite one of my favorite tools in Node. :grinning:

At the moment there isn't anything interesting in here. If you are interested in this app, head over to the old C++ version and use that.
