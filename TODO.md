 - [ ] Improve the command prompt with the unicode tools
 - [x] ~~Implement history manager (some stuff got implemented in readline already)~~ </br>
       Everything is part of the native GNU/Readline addon
 - [ ] Find out how I can do this in Node -> **kbhit** [cpp](https://github.com/GhettoGirl/MusicConsole/blob/master/Sys/kbhit.cpp), [hpp](https://github.com/GhettoGirl/MusicConsole/blob/master/Sys/kbhit.hpp) </br>
       This is very important and I need this for this project!!
